Scripts for Continuous Delivery of my projects on SnapCI.
Feel free to modify and use them.

They're on [BSD Zero Clause license] (https://spdx.org/licenses/0BSD.html),
so you can do whatever you want with them without copying my license.
But a mention is always nice :)

Commit messages following [AngularJS conventions] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit) are parsed by the script to determine the build type.
